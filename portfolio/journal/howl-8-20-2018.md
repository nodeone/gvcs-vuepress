# It’s All About Community 

There are a lot of things that make GVCS a very special place. Topping the list most certainly, are our amazing teachers. They are passionate, brilliant, dedicated and hardworking, I could go on and on – truly. It could be our incredible students and their families – inquisitive, creative, engaged, purposeful – and just all around awesome. We all come together to dig into meaningful work – to apply academic learning, honed high quality student products and are directed by strong character – to answer that age old question – “Why do I need to know this?” To answer this question and to collect real data we head out into the world as a Crew - to learn, and apply that learning to do good in our local and global community. What could be better than that? So it really is all about community, and that was highly visible last Friday at our Welcome Back to School BBQ. A hearty thank you to all who pitched in to make it happen. It is a big lift for the first week of school! A special shout out of appreciation to our newest families to join GVCS for attending the BBQ, and to our time honored families who took them under their wing. We are Crew and thus I know it is going to be an amazing year!
